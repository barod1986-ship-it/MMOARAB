# This is a placeholder for the compiled Arabic translation file (ar.mo)
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary file generated from ar.po
# using tools like msgfmt or Poedit.
#
# To generate the actual .mo file, run:
# msgfmt ar.po -o ar.mo
#
# For now, this is just a placeholder to maintain the directory structure
# as specified in the README.md requirements.

# Binary MO file content would be here in a real implementation
